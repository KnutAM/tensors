# Tensor Analysis
Tensors let us to describe the physical world around us in a compact mathematical fashion. At first, using tensors might seem like a detour. But once you master the art of tensor manipulation, there is no looking back!

The main content on this page is in the [Theory](/Theory) section. Here, the concept of tensors is introduced along with various tensor operations. In addition, two support pages show the [notation](/Notation) used and the [voigt representation](/Voigt). This page is a live document and should be continuously improved.
