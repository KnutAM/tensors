# Tensor Analysis
Tensors let us describe the physical world around us in a compact mathematical fashion. 
At first, using tensors might seem like a detour. 
But once you master the art of tensor manipulation, there is no looking back!

The main content on this page is in the [Theory](/Theory) section, 
introducing the concept of tensors along with various tensor operations. 
In addition, two support pages show the [notation](/Notation) used and the [voigt representation](/Voigt). 
This page is a live document and should be continuously improved. 
There are two ways you can contribute to this improvement while also learning more yourself:

1. [**Open issue**](https://github.com/KnutAM/tensors/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=founderror.md&title=) (link on every page) if you
   * Spot an error
   * Find something hard to understand
   * Have a suggestion for an improvement

2. **Pull requests** are also welcome! (See [here](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/) for an introduction)
