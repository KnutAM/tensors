# Tensor Analysis
Tensors let us to describe the physical world around us in a compact mathematical fashion. At first, using tensors might seem like a detour. But once you master the art of tensor manipulations there is no looking back!

This page have 3 main areas, [Theory](/Theory), [Examples](/Examples) and [Reference](/Reference). All definitions and motivations are described in the [Theory](/Theory) area, which can be considered as lecture material. The [Examples](/Examples) area contains example exercises with solution procedures. Typically, these exercises would be demonstrated by the teacher. Finally, the [Reference](/Reference) area contains a condensed set of definitions and identities covered in the [Theory](/Theory) part.
