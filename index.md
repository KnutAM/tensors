# Tensor Analysis
Tensors let us describe the physical world around us in a compact mathematical fashion. At first, using tensors might seem like a detour. But once you master the art of tensor manipulation, there is no looking back!

The main content on this page is in the [Theory](/Theory) section, introducing the concept of tensors along with various tensor operations. In addition, two support pages show the [notation](/Notation) used and the [voigt representation](/Voigt). This page is a live document and should be continuously improved. There are three ways you can contribute to this improvement while also learning more yourself:

1. **Something is unclear**: Click "Discuss page contents" and contribute to the discussion on the relevant page
2. **Something is wrong**: Click "Report errors" on that page to open an issue on GitHub
3. **Something is wrong, and you have a suggestion to fix**: "Pull requests" are welcome! (see e.g. [distributed version control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/))
